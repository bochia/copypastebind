# copypastebind

This program allows you to bind copied text to numbers 0-9 on your keyboard. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the program on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

* You're operating system must be Windows.

* You will need to install AutoHotKey. When downloading the AutoHotKey package your browser may say it's unsafe. I did some research and everyone said it was safe so I took a leap of faith.

* You must have a mouse with at least 2 additional buttons.

## Installing

Simply copy paste the code into a empty notepad file and save it as ANY_NAME_YOU_DESIRE.ahk

## Usage

### Binding text to a number

1.) Highlight text you wish to bind to a number.

2.) Press additional mouse button closest to you along with any number, 0-9, you wish to save the copied text too.

### Pasting text binded to a number

1.) Press additional mouse button farthest away from you along with any number, 0-9, to paste text binded to that number.
